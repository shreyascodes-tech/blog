# JavaScript the practical Guide

In this article I will teach the basics of JavaScript, so let us get started

> **before you start**: This article assumes that you have a basic understanding
> of any other programming language. You don't have to be an expert but should
> know basics like what a variable is or what an operator is for example


## What is JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the most used programming language in the world, used by
the biggest companies in the world liek Netflix, Google, Amazon, Facebook,
Instagram, Twitter, PayPal and many more. If you see any website that has a
basic interactivity then it most likely is built with JavaScript.

## What can JavaScript be used for

JavaScript started as a programming language to be used to add interactivity to
a website. To run JavaScript code browsers use a JavaScript engine that parses
and executes the code we write. So a very talented developer named
[Ryan Dahl](https://github.com/ry) took the JavaScript engine from chrome (v8
engine) and wrapped it in a c++ program and called it
[Node Js](https://nodejs.org), now we can execute JavaScript outside of a
browser too which led to a lot of innovation in the space. To answer the
question what can be built with JavaScript, well

    - Websites (obviously)
    - Mobile Apps
    - Desktop Apps
    - Server Side Apps
    - Realtime Apps ( like live chats and media streaming services ) 
    - Games
    - Command Line Apps

and so many more things can be built with JavaScript

## The JavaScript Engine

JavaScript is a scripting language and is interpreted, meaning it can't directly
run on a cpu. So to run JS code we need an `engine` that well converts the JS
code we write into instructions that a CPU can understand and execute. There are
a lot of different JS runtimes such as

    - Chrome's V8 engine
    - Safari's JavaScript Core engine
    - Firefox's SpiderMonkey engine

JavaScript itself doen't have anything to do many practical things except
performing some basic logical operations like Math. To combat this These engines
are wrapped in higher level programs like a Browser or Node JS to give it access
to features like Networking, FileSystem access etc

## The ECMAScript standard

JavaScript is a very popular programming language but there are a lot of
different browsers and different engines so every browser implements JavaScript
in its own way which is a massive problem for developers because some features
supported by some browsers are not supported by some other browser. This is a
problem that we are still suffering from but the good news is most big browsers
are adopting the ECMAScript standard which is a standard maintained by an
organisation named **ECMA**. ECMAScript is specification that the JavaScript
programming language confirms to.

ES2015 or ES6 is an ECMAScript that brings so many modern features to JavaScript
like import/export syntax Promises, Generators etc. We will take a look at some
of the features introduced in ES6 in this article


## The Browser Console

As we know we need a JavaScript engine to run our code so to run js in a browser one of the
easiest way is to run it int the Browser Console

1. if you are on a mobile device please switch to a pc

1. open the browser dev tools, `Ctrl + Shift + j` or `Cmd + Option + j` is the
   shortcut to open it in most browsers

1. go to the console tab in the dev tools pane and you can start writing JS
   there

## Hello World

The most basic program you can write in a programming language is printing
"Hello World"

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

copy the above code into the console and hit enter to run it

ðŸŽŠ wohooo you've written your very first JavaScript program, If you run the above
code int the console it prints `Hello World` as you might have expected

## An IDE for JavaScript
This is a practical JavaScript tutorial but we hvae used a browser console to write
our JavaScript which is not very practical

So to write JavaScript I suggest [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) It has js support
out of the box
- Create a .js file
- Write your JS
- Save the file

## Executing your code
Running JavaScript requires a runtime/engine as you know so to run your JS

### To run your JS in a browser
- Create a file with `.html` extension alongside your js file
- Paste the following code in it and replace `yourjsfile.js` with your js file name
    ```html
    <html>
        <body>
            <script src="yourjsfile.js"></script>
        </body>
    </html>
- If Done right the files should look something like this
    <br>
    <img src="/assets/intro-to-js/file-structure.png" height="200" alt="File Structure" >
    <br>
-  Install a VSCode extension called live server
- Open The html file
- Right click and select open with live server
- A browser window should open
- Open the console here
- Now start writing your code in the js file
- As soon as you savve the file your output should be visible in the console

**Enough theory let's start learning some JavaScript**

## Comments

There are two types of comments in JavaScript **Single Line Comments** these
start with `//`

example

```js
// This is a single line comment that will not be parsed or executed by JS engine
```

**Multi Line or Block Comments** anything between `/*  */` is a block comment

example

```js
/*
    This is a block comment that
    Spans multiple lines
*/
```

**Doc Comments** anything between `/**  */` is a doc comment, doc comments are
used to give additional information about a variable, function, class etc to the
developer using our code or help our future selves to undersstannd a complex
piece of code that may be hard to understand

example

```js
/**
    This is a function that calculates the factorial of a number
*/
function factorial(n) {
  if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

> We will discuss more about functions in later sections

## Data Types

JavaScript has two categories of data types

1. Value Types
   - string
   - number
   - boolean
   - undefined
   - null
1. Reference Types
   - array
   - object

we will look at each of them in detail soon

## Variables

Variable is a container that can store some piece of data in the memory with a
name assignned to it

### Creating Variables

in JavaScript a variable declaration starts with the `let` keyword followed by
an identifier and optionally a value assigned to it

for example

```js
let variable1;
let num = 10;
```

If you log these in the console like so you should see `undefined 10` printed to
the console

```js
console.log(variable1, num);
```

_**Variables can be re assigned**_

example

```js
let myVar = 10;
console.log(myVar); // 10
myVar = 20;
console.log(myVar); // 20
```

> **Note**: you can also create variables using the `var` keyword but it is a
> leagcy JavaScript feature, please avoid using it as much as possible, and no I
> am not going to talk about it here

### Constants

A constant in JavaScript is just like a variable but it cannot be re assigned

### Creating Constants

Constants in JavaScript is created with the `const` keyword followed by an
identifier followed by a value assignment (which is not optional)

for example

```js
const PI = 3.141592653;

console.log(PI); // 3.141592653
```

> **Note**: It is common to name literal constants like PI in all uppercase

## The Number Type
In JavaScript there is only one number type that represents any kind of number 
like integer or a floating point number

### Some operations on numbers

Addition
```js
let add = 10 + 20 // add = 20
add += 10 // adds 10 to the current add value
console.log(add); // 30
```

Subtraction
```js
let diff = 10 - 20 // diff = -10
diff -= 10
console.log(diff); // diff = 0
```

Multiplication
```js
let prod = 1.5 * 20 // prod = 30
prod *= 2 // prod = 60
```

Division
```js
let div = 3 / 2 // div = 1.5
div /= 1.5 // div = 1
```

Power
```js
let cube = 3 ** 3 // cube = 27
```

Increment
```js
let i = 0;
i++;
console.log(i); // 1
```

Decrement
```js
let d = 1;
d--;
console.log(d); // 0
```


## The String Type
In JavaScript strings are a sequence of characters but unlike other languages we don't have special
type that represents a single character

example
```js
let name = "Shreyas"
console.log(name); // Shreyas
```
Strings can be created with single quotes or double quotes
example
```js
let quote = 'Shreyas said, "JavaScript is a programming language"'
console.log(quote); // Shreyas said, "JavaScript is a programming language"
```
example
```js
let sentence = "It's a line with single quotes"
console.log(name); // It's a line with single quotes
```

## String operations
uppercase
example
```js
// To Upper Case
console.log("ThIS iS a StrINg".toUpperCase()); // THIS IS A STRING
// To Lower Case
console.log("ThIS iS a StrINg".toLowerCase()); // this is a string

// String Concatenation
let world = "World" + "!";
console.log("Hello" + ", " + world); // Hello, World!

// Number to a string
let n = 4;
console.log(n.toString()); // 4

// Strintg to a number
let str = "12345"
console.log(+str); // 12345 (in color :) )
```

## String Template literals
This is a simpler from of string concatenation
```js
let hello = "Hello";
let world = "World";
let str = `${hello}, ${world}!`;
console.log(str); // Hello, World!
```

## The Boolean type
Bolean is JavaScript represents a true or false condition.
There are two boolean literals `true` and `false`

for example
```js
let isGrater = 3 > 4; // false because 3 is less than 4
```

## Logical operators

### Negation
returns the opposite boolean value of the given value
example

```js
console.log(!true); // false
console.log(!false); // true
```
> Also works with value types too, in JavaScript every value can be coersed (implicitly converted) into a boolean value a few examples are given below
```js
console.log(!0); // true
console.log(!1, !2); // false
console.log(!""); // true
console.log(!"non empty"); // false

console.log(!null, !undefined); // true true
```
### Double Negation
can be used to find the truth value of a value or a variable
for example
```js
let x = 10;
let y; // undefined
let z = null;
let e = "";
let nonE = "non empty";

console.log(!!x); // true
console.log(!!y); // false
console.log(!!z); // false
console.log(!!e); // false
console.log(!!nonE); // true

```

### Equlity
Unlike other languages JavaScript has two equality operators
1. The `==` operator
1. The `===` operator

We will only use the second one because it's modern and actually logical

The equality operator returns true if both the values are equal

example
```js
let isEqual = 10 === (5 + 5) // true
isEqual = "10" === 10 // false
```
> ***note*** ```"10" == 10``` with `==` returns true because of something called type coersion which we aren't ging to go in depth into but remember to use `===` and not `==`

### other logical operators
- Grater than and Less than
```js
// Grater than
console.log(10 > 20); // false
// Lesser than
console.log(10 < 20); // true
// Grater than or equal
console.log(10 >= 20); // false
// Lesser than or equal
console.log(10 <= 10); // true
```


## The Ternary operator
Used to assign a value based on a condition

for example
```js
let condition = 6 <= 10; // condition = true
let value = condition ? 6 : 4 // value = 6 because 6 is less than or equal to 10
```

## Control flow

### if else

example
```js
if (3 > 4) {
    console.log("3 > 4 ?");
} else if (1 === 1) {
    console.log("It's true");
} else {
    console.log("Not Possible");
}
```

### While
loops until the condition provided returns true

example
```js
while (true) {
    // Runs forever
} // Running this in your browser will crash the page

// This code logs 0 to 9 in the console
let x = 0;
while (x < 10) {
    console.log(x);
    x++;
}
```

### For

example
```js
// This logs 0 to 9 to the console
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

## Arrays
arrays are a sequence of values of any type

### Creating an array
```js
let arr = [1, "Banana", true, null]
```

### Finding the length of an array
```js
console.log(arr.length); // 4
```

### Accessing elements of an array

> Arrays in JavaScript are zero indexed so the numbering of elements of array starts from 0

```js
console.log(arr[0]); // 1
console.log(arr[1]); // Banana
console.log(arr[2]); // true
console.log(arr[3]); // null
```
> ***Note*** There is no out of bounds error if you try to access an eement at a non existing index it just returns `undefined`

example
```js
console.log(arr[4]); // undefined
console.log(arr[-6]); // undefined
```

### Modifying the array

Adding elements at the end
```js
arr.push(5);
console.log(arr); // [ 1, 'Banana', true, null, 5 ]
```

Removing elements from the end
```js
arr.pop(); // 5
console.log(arr); // [ 1, 'Banana', true, null ]
```

## Objects
objects in JavaScript are just key value pairs (like hash map/dictionary/associative 
arrays in other languages)

example
```js
let person = {
    name: "Person's Name",
    age: 34
}

console.log(person); // { name: "Person's Name", age: 34 }
```

### accessing properties of an object
```js
console.log(person.name); // Person's Name
console.log(person.age); // 34

// OR 
console.log(person["name"]); // Person's Name
console.log(person["age"]); // 34

// We can modify the values of an object too
person.age = 35
console.log(person.age); // 35
```

## Functions
Function is a block of code that can take 0 or more input parameters and 
return 0 or 1 output that only runs when explicitly called 

example
```js

function simpleFunction() {
    console.log("Log from a function");
}

simpleFunction() // Log from a function

function withParams(name, age) {
    console.log(`Hi I am ${name} and I am ${age} years old`);
}

withParams("Alice", 24) // Hi I am Alice and I am 24 years old

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

let sum = add(3,4)
console.log(sum); // 7
```


## Object methods
There can be functions associated with objects too

example
```js
let person = {
    firstName: "Bob",
    lastName: "Smith",
    getName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
}
```
> the `this` keyword in the constructor represents the current object instance

## Constructor Functions
Unlike other Object oriented languages there are no classes in JavaScript
> ***Note*** There are classes in JavaScript but are syntactic sugar for Constructor functions

example
```js
function User(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.name = `${firstName} ${lastName}`
}
```


new user objects can be created from the Constructor function

```js
let john = new User("John", "Doe")
console.log(john); // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', name: 'John Doe' }
```

## The Prototype
The most dreaded concept of JavaScript is the Prototype but let's make it simpler

In the above constructor we assign name attribute to the combination of first and last name
but what if we change either of the properties after object instanciation (creation), it doesn;t update
to fix this we will add a prototype method to the User function to compute the name of the user when called

**This is same as the object method but this applies to all the objects created with this constructor**

example
```js

User.prototype.getName = function () {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
}

// Now let's use it

let jane = new User("Jane", "Smith")
console.log(jane.getName()); // Jane Smith
console.log(jane.name); // Jane Smith

// If we change the user's properties

jane.lastName = "Doe"
console.log(jane.getName()); // Jane Doe
console.log(jane.name); // Jane Smith

// the prototype method returns the updated name but the name property doesn't
```

## The Class
Weiting constructor functions and the prototype methods is a mess and not very 
maintainable so most modern browsers support the class declaration which is identical 
to a constructor function but is simpler to write and maintain

Let's re-write the User constructor with class syntax
```js
class User {

    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName
        this.lastName = lastName
    }

    getName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }

}
```
As you can see this is much simpler to write and understand

## Inheritance
JavaScript supports prototypal inheritance which is basically inheritance but with prototypes
We can inherit a different prototype for a different prototype but that's messy and not readable 
so we will simply stick to the class syntax

create a base class
```js
class Animal {
    constructor(name, sound) {
        this.name = name;
        this.sound = sound;
    }

    makeSound() {
        console.log(`${this.name} says ${this.sound}`);
    }
}
```

extend the clsss
```js
class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(legs) {
        // calling the base class constructor
        super("Dog", "BOW BOW!!")
    }

    bark() {
        // call the base class method
        super.makeSound()
    }
}

let d = new Dog()
// calling the base class method
d.makeSound() // Dog says BOW BOW!!
d.bark() // Dog says BOW BOW!!
```
> Methods in the derived class can override those from the base class by just re-defining the method in the derived class with the same name and the super.method() calls the base class method even ofter overriding the method

## JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
This is a data exchange format that can be used to transfer data between two different programs
JSON is a string with the data encoded as a JavaScript object

JSON supportsall the JavaScript types except functions

### creating JSON string

```js
let person = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 32,
    graduated: true,
    hobbies: [
        "playing",
        "listening to music"
    ]
}

let json = JSON.stringify(person)
console.log(json); // {"name":"John Doe","age":32,"graduated":true,"hobbies":["playing","listening to music"]}
```

Now this JSON string can be sent to a differnt server or a program

### getting the actual object back from the JSON string

```js
let data = JSON.parse(`{"name":"John Doe","age":32,"graduated":true,"hobbies":["playing","listening to music"]}`);
console.log(data);
// { 
//     name: 'John Doe',
//     age: 32,
//     graduated: true,
//     hobbies: [ 'playing', 'listening to music' ]
// }
```
