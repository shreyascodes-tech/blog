# JavaScript the practical Guide

In this article I will teach the basics of JavaScript, the practical way no boring theory that no body cares, so let us get started

> **before you start**: This article assumes that you have a basic understanding of any other programming language. You don't have to be an expert but should know basics like what a variable is or what an operator is for example

## Running your code

This is a practical guide to JavaScript so you will need to write some code and this is how you do it

1.  if you are on a mobile device please switch to a pc

2.  open the browser dev tools, `Ctrl + Shift + j` or `Cmd + Option + j` is the shortcut to open it in most browsers

3.  go to the console tab in the dev tools pane and you can start writing JS there

## Hello World

The most basic program you can write in a programming language is printing "Hello World"

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

copy the above code into the console and hit enter to run it

ðŸŽŠ wohooo you've written your very first JavaScript program, If you run the above code int the console it prints `Hello World` as you might have expected

## The Runtime

JavaScript is a scripting language is interpreted, meaning it can't directly run on a cpu.
So to run JS code we need a `runtime` that well converts the JS code we write into instructions that a CPU can understand and execute. There are a lot of different JS runtimes such as 

    - Chrome's V8 engine
    - Safari's JavaScript Core engine
    - Firefox's SpiderMonkey engine
JavaScript itself doen't have anything to do practical things
